# 🤖 AI Projects Portfolio

Welcome to my **Artificial Intelligence Projects Portfolio**!  
This repository is a curated collection of my machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and NLP projects — built with passion, precision, and purpose.

> 📌 “Learning by building” — this is where I turn theory into real-world applications.

## 🔍 What's Inside?

Each folder contains a **standalone AI project** complete with code, documentation, and (when applicable) Streamlit apps, model files, and datasets (or links to them).

| Project | Domain | Technologies | Summary |
|--------|--------|--------------|---------|
| [`📰 Fake News Detection`](./FakeNewsDetection) | NLP | Scikit-learn, Pandas, TF-IDF | A binary classifier that detects whether a news article is real or fake using natural language processing and traditional ML models. |
| [`🎨 Image Filters App`](./ImageFiltersApp) | Computer Vision | OpenCV, Streamlit | A web app that applies real-time image filters (grayscale, sketch, blur, edge detection) to uploaded images. |
| [`📷 CIFAR-10 Image Classification`](./ImageClassifier) | Deep Learning | TensorFlow, Streamlit | A CNN-based app that classifies CIFAR-10 images into 10 categories. Also includes a transfer learning model using EfficientNetV2B0. |
| _More coming soon..._ | | | |
